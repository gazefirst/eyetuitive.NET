![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/eyetuitive.NET?style=flat-square)

Use this repo / its published nuget package to integrate eyetuitive in your next .NET project / product.

## Connection

You can connect to eyetuitive via gRPC. Since the transport is based on HTTP/2, you need support for that. Also, ensure you can access the device via the network. The service runs on host eyetracker.local, port 12340.

## Note on legacy .NET versions

This library supports .NET 6 and .NET 8 (both LTS). However, .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later are only supported on Windows 11, since some underlying legacy gRPC implementations only support WinHttpHandler with http2 in Windows 11.

## Sample

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// eyetuitive instance
/// </summary>
private eyetuitive device = new eyetuitive();

/// <summary>
/// Connect to the eye tracker
/// </summary>
private async Task Connect()
{
	bool connected = await device.ConnectAsync();
	device.Position.StartPositionTracking(posHandler);
	device.Gaze.StartGazeTracking(gazeHandler);
}

/// <summary>
/// Handle gaze data
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sender"></param>
/// <param name="e"></param>
private void gazeHandler(object sender, GazeEventArgs e)
{
	NormedPoint2d gazepoint = e.gazePoint; //Normed as 0-1d - multiply with screen resolution if needed
}

/// <summary>
/// Handle position data
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sender"></param>
/// <param name="e"></param>
private void posHandler(object sender, PositionEventArgs e)
{
	NormedPoint2d leftEyePosition = e.leftEyePos; //Normed as 0-1d - multiply with screen resolution if needed
	NormedPoint2d rightEyePosition = e.rightEyePos; //Normed as 0-1d - multiply with screen resolution if needed
}
```
